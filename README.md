# Senior-Project-App
This is a business application developed by my team and I for my undergraduate degree.

My team consisted of:
-Two Java programmers
-One technical writer
-One team leader(database developer/programmer)

My main role was team leader; allocating workloads to each team member, coordinating meetings, and ensuring milestones were met
before deadlines. Along with contributing to each stage of the development life cycle
I also created the database, created use cases, data flow charts, and system hierarchy diagrams.
